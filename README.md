# 2048 Python version

In [2048](https://github.com/inimino/2048/) we have a JS version of the game that is playable on the client side.
However, since everything happens on the client side, we can't save any results on the server, such as high scores, and we wouldn't be able to trust scores submitted from the client side anyway.

To make a more full-featured version of the game, we might want to have a proper backend.
For this we'll try a Python implementation.
